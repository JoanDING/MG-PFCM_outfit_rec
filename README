We save the meta data of IQON3000 in the file of "iqon_item_metadata_all.json" and "item_img_num.csv".
The attribute values of fashion items are numeric, and the correnponding relationship is stored in the "att2num".

We first select the pair data that only contains top and bottom fashion items from the origin IQON3000 dataset by "iqon_data.py",
the result is saved as "iqon_data_pair.json".

Afterwards, we preprocess the pair data by "preprocess/data_preprocess.py".
The results are saved in "preprocess/graph_data" and "preprocess/non-graph_data", which can be applied to graph method and non-graph method, respectively.
